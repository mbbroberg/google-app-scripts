# google-app-scripts
Google Docs are best when scripted. Here are some tools I've built for re-use on occasion.

## About

Google Docs has an incredible feature that I sometimes forget to leverage. Under `Tools` there's the `Script editor`. This repository is a collection of scripts I use to interact with other platfroms at that point.

**Projects:**

* Slack Push - use Slack's webhook functionality to push details of the completed form to a channel
* Send Email - a way to script emails in response to a form completion  

## Contribute

Feel free to fork this repository. From there: 

* Add a new folder for each project
* Include a few sentences of README.md in that folder that explains what it does and any variables that are important to edit
* Give a one-liner description for your project under Projects above
